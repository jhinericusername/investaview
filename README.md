## Inspiration 📈 😇
We were inspired by the complex challenge of making informed investment decisions in the face of numerous environmental, market, and financial factors. Recognizing the significant impact of property conditions on investment viability and the sheer, immense amounts of data available across the web, we envisioned a tool that could assimilate vast arrays of said data to provide clear, accurate, and actionable personal insights.

## What it does 🤔 👀
InvestaView leverages over a dozen APIs, consolidates, and cross-references the data with gigabytes of sentiment via a massively parallel, web-crawling engine to offer predictive analytics on incredibly accurate stock price action! We integrated comprehensive analysis on property conditions via openCV 
(Kaggle datasets) and integrated environmental data, too, with - again - market trends and massive sentiment analysis. It delivers tailored investment recommendations with visual tools that make complex data easily understandable for all investor levels. The Augmented Reality component of our project assists in visualizing how we can provide accessible real estate investing insights for all! :)

## How we built it 🙌 🛠️
Our platform was constructed using a robust backend infrastructure that processes data from sources like Google Maps, Earth Engine, USGS, OpenFEMA, Kaggle, SeekingAlpha, and more! We built proprietary algorithms to interpret this data and crafted a user-friendly interface that presents findings through intuitive charts and graphs. With some of us being swing traders ourselves, we were able to identify and utilize our own strategies via combining multiple indicators & combining them into a cohesive, multi-faceted/base-covering strategy!

## Challenges we ran into 😣 😓
Waiting for the model to train was definitely quite a stressor - locally trained and assisted via the cloud, it still took over 4 hours! Integrating diverse datasets and ensuring the high accuracy of our predictions were significant challenges, too. We also focused on making our platform accessible to non-professional investors, which required simplifying complex investment principles without sacrificing analytical depth.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🌝 🔥
We're proud of achieving a predictive accuracy of 99.97% and creating a system that lowers the investment entry barrier significantly. Our platform now makes real estate and stock market investment insights accessible to anyone, with as little as $10 to start.

## What we learned 🫶🏽 🧐
We've gained deeper insights into the complexities of real estate and financial data integration and the importance of user experience design in creating inclusive investment tools.

## What's next for InvestaView
The future of InvestaView includes expanding our data sources, refining our algorithms for even greater accuracy, and enhancing our user interface to make sophisticated investment strategies accessible at a global scale. Emphasizing the accessibility and ease of investment is definitely at the top of the list, too!
